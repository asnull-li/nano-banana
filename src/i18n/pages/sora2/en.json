        "question": "What is Sora 2 and how does it differ from other video generators?",
        "answer": "Sora 2 is OpenAI's latest AI video generation model that represents a major breakthrough in video AI technology. Unlike previous video generators that distort objects and bend reality, Sora 2 follows real-world physics laws with unprecedented accuracy. It can simulate complex scenarios like Olympic-level gymnastics, surfboard backflips with accurate buoyancy and rigidity dynamics, and natural object interactions. Sora 2 generates videos from text prompts or reference images with cinematic quality, realistic motion effects, and physics consistency."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the key features of Sora 2 video generation?",
        "answer": "Sora 2 offers several groundbreaking features: dual-mode generation (text-to-video and image-to-video), advanced physics simulation with realistic motion, flexible aspect ratios for portrait and landscape formats, high-definition output options up to 15 seconds in length, precise creative control over scenes and styles, and support for photorealistic, cinematic, and anime aesthetics. The model also features enhanced prompt adherence and can execute complex multi-shot instructions while maintaining consistent world states throughout the video."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to generate videos with Sora 2?",
        "answer": "Generation time varies based on the model version and settings you choose. Sora 2 standard quality typically takes 3-5 minutes to generate. For Sora 2 Pro with HD quality: 10-second HD videos typically take 10-20 minutes to generate, and 15-second HD videos take around 30 minutes (this reflects OpenAI's native delivery speed). We strongly recommend using the 15-second HD option with caution, as it takes longer and may have minor imperfections. You can leave the page after submitting - completed videos will appear in your My Creations section."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do my video generations keep failing?",
        "answer": "Video generation failures typically occur due to content policy violations. OpenAI's safety systems will block requests that contain: realistic photos of identifiable people (to prevent deepfakes and misuse), sexually explicit content, graphic violence or gore, or other prohibited content. To ensure successful generation, avoid uploading realistic human face photos and refrain from using prompts that describe violent, explicit, or harmful content. If you believe your content is appropriate but still experiencing failures, try rephrasing your prompt or using different reference images."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Sora 2 handle physics and realism in generated videos?",
        "answer": "Sora 2 excels at physical accuracy and realism. When a basketball player misses a shot, the ball bounces off the backboard naturally instead of teleporting to the hoop like in older models. The system can simulate proper buoyancy, object permanence, gravity, and material properties. This physics consistency makes Sora 2 suitable for creating realistic training simulations, sports content, and professional creative projects that require authentic motion dynamics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Sora 2 for social media and commercial content?",
        "answer": "Yes! Sora 2 is perfect for social media and commercial applications. The model generates videos up to 15 seconds long with flexible aspect ratios optimized for different platforms - portrait format for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts, or landscape for traditional video content. Videos generated with Sora 2 through our platform are suitable for commercial use in marketing, advertising, and content creation. The system produces high-quality output without watermarks, ready for immediate publishing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes Sora 2 better at following prompts than earlier models?",
        "answer": "Sora 2 demonstrates significantly improved prompt adherence compared to earlier video generation models. It can execute complex, multi-part instructions across multiple shots while maintaining visual and narrative consistency. The model understands detailed descriptions of camera movements, character actions, scene transitions, and artistic styles. This enhanced controllability allows creators to achieve specific creative visions with precision, whether generating realistic documentary-style footage, cinematic sequences, or stylized animations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does Sora 2 cost and how does the credit system work?",
        "answer": "Sora 2 uses a transparent credit-based pricing system. Each video generation consumes credits based on your selected settings such as resolution, aspect ratio, and video duration (up to 15 seconds maximum). Standard quality generations require fewer credits, while high-definition outputs use more. You can purchase credit packages that fit your production needs. No subscription required - only pay for what you generate. Check the workspace interface for current credit costs per generation."
